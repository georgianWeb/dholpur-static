                World Sunrise Public School strictly emphasizes on the moral
                development of the child. It believes that the supreme end of
                the educative process should be the training of characters and
                personality of students in such a way that they will be able to
                realize their full potentialities and contribute to the well
                being of the community. It is education which can impart the
                ability or power of better judgment and build strong characters.
                Desirable qualities of head, heart and hand are ingrained
                through our system of education. Students here acquire these
                qualities not passively or theoretically but by in and through
                activities. They participate being led by their self- interest
                and with an eye to the meaning in connection with real life.
                Acquiring life skills is thereby a very essential and integral
                part of our educational process. Our ultimate concern is not
                only to cultivate wealth of muscles, fullness of knowledge or
                refinement of feelings but also the strength and purity of
                character.
              </p>
              <h4>Parents Our Partners in Education</h4>
              <p>
                Modern education gives emphasis on the immediate needs,
                interests and experiences of child and considers individual
                differences. There is the need of establishing effective parent-
                teacher cooperation. It is the home which lays the foundation
                and then the school builds up the edifice of the child’s life.
                Parent- teacher cooperation is highly encouraged at World
                Sunrise Public School. Parents participate in school functions,
                teaching activities and volunteer on special occasions. In order
                to make parents more responsible for learning and well being of
                their child we motivate parents to offer their valuable
                suggestions and give necessary feedback either through mails or
                feedback drop box. Professional parents are urged to share their
                valuable experiences with children as part of our Guest Lecture
                Series. The social development of a child is thus made possible
                by securing parental cooperation. We salute our parents for
                their unstinted support and cooperation.
